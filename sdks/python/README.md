# caspian-sdk

**Give your AI agent one identity that reaches any human, on whatever app they already use** — email, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, SMS, X, Telegram, iMessage — all behind a single `on_message` handler.

You write the handler once. Caspian handles the provider quirks, threading, delivery, and dedup for every channel.

```bash
pip install caspian-sdk
```

## Quickstart

```python
from caspian_sdk import CommClient

client = CommClient(api_key="YOUR_KEY")

# Connect any channel — email needs nothing; others take a token or one-click OAuth.
inbox = client.connect_email()
print("Agent address:", inbox["address"])

@client.on_message
def handle(message):
    # The same handler answers every channel you connect.
    message.reply(f"Thanks! You said: {message.text}")

client.listen()  # one loop, every channel
```

## Channels

| | Connect |
|---|---|
| **Email** | `connect_email()` — default domain or your own |
| **Slack** | `install_slack()` (one-click) or `connect_slack(...)` |
| **Discord** | `install_discord()` (one-click) or `connect_discord(...)` |
| **X / Twitter** | `install_x()` (one-click) or `connect_x(...)` |
| **WhatsApp** | `connect_whatsapp(...)` (Caspian hosted) |
| **SMS / phone** | `connect_phone(...)` — own GSM modem, or Caspian hosted |
| **Telegram** | `connect_telegram(bot_token=...)` |
| **iMessage** | `connect_imessage()` (Caspian hosted) |

## How it works

- **One handler, every channel.** Adding a channel is another `connect_*()` call — never new handler code.
- **`message.reply()`** answers in the right thread on the right channel automatically.
- **`message.typing()`** shows a "typing…" indicator while your agent thinks (where the platform supports it).
- **`client.listen()`** is resilient — a handler error or a dropped poll won't stop the loop.
